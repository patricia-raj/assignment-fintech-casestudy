# Regulatory Technology - ComplyAdvantage

## <ins>RegTech Introduction:</ins>
    RegTech is the management of regulatory processes within the financial industry.
    The main functions of regtech include regulatory monitoring, reporting, and compliance.
    It consists of a community of companies that help businesses comply with regulations efficiently and less expensively.

    > The global RegTech Market size is expected to grow USD 7.6 billion in 2021 to USD 19.5 billion by 2026, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 20.8%.

## Origin: 

    The rise in digital products has increased data breaches, cyber hacks, money laundering, and other fraudulent activities.  
    Regtech reduces the risk to a company’s compliance department by offering data on money laundering activities conducted online—activities that a traditional compliance team may not be privy to due to the increase of underground marketplaces online.
    Regtech tools seek to monitor transactions that take place online in real-time to identify issues or irregularities in the digital payment sphere. Any outlier is relayed to the financial institution to analyze and determine if fraudulent activity is taking place. Institutions that identify potential threats to financial security early on are able to minimize the risks and costs associated with lost funds and data breaches.

## Importance of RegTech:

    A bank that receives huge amounts of data may find it too complex, expensive, and time-consuming to comb through. A regtech firm can combine complex information from a bank with data from previous regulatory failures to predict potential risk areas that the bank should focus on. By creating the analytics tools needed for these banks to successfully comply with the regulatory body, the regtech firm saves the bank time and money. The bank also has an effective tool to comply with rules set out by financial authorities. 
    With the use of big data and machine-learning technology, Regtech tools seek to monitor transactions that take place online in real-time to identify issues or irregularities in the digital payment sphere. Any outlier is relayed to the financial institution to analyze and determine if fraudulent activity is taking place. Institutions that identify potential threats to financial security early on are able to minimize the risks and costs associated with lost funds and data breaches.
